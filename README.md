**A Machine Learning Framework for Understanding the Link between Parental Education, Socioeconomic Status, and Student Performance**

*Presented at the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence & Sustainable Computing (AISC 2025), Kolkata, India*

## üöÄ Executive Summary

This study investigates how high school students' achievement is impacted by demographics, parental education, and socioeconomic factors through a comprehensive machine learning approach. Using a dataset of 1,000 students, we examine the effects of test preparation courses, lunch type (as SES proxy), parental education levels, gender, and race/ethnicity on math, reading, and writing scores.

**Key Findings:**
- Students with higher parental education consistently achieve better scores across all subjects
- Socioeconomic status (measured via lunch type) significantly impacts math and writing performance
- Test preparation completion provides measurable performance boosts (+7 points average)
- Gender differences show boys slightly leading in math while girls excel in reading and writing
- Linear Regression outperforms complex models with R¬≤ = 0.145, indicating scope for enhanced feature engineering

The results demonstrate substantial variation in academic achievement, with better scores in all areas being correlated with greater parental education levels. Students whose parents held bachelor's or master's degrees routinely outperformed classmates whose parents had less education.

## üéØ Business Problem

**Challenge:** How can schools and policymakers identify the most impactful factors (parental education context, socioeconomic indicators, test preparation access, demographic variables) that influence student academic performance to optimize resource allocation and maximize learning outcomes?

**Impact:** Enable data-driven educational interventions that address systemic inequities in access to educational resources and improve academic success for all students through targeted, evidence-based programs.

**Research Questions:**
- What is the relationship between parental education levels and student academic performance across math, reading, and writing?
- How does socioeconomic status (proxied by lunch type) influence educational outcomes?
- Which machine learning models best predict student performance based on demographic and socioeconomic factors?
- What are the gender-based differences in academic performance across subjects?
